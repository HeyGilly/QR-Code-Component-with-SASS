### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS library


### What I learned
- First time working with SASS


### Continued development
- I can understand why developers use SASS, It took me a long time to understand the purpose of using it. I was strongly on CSS and I believe I will start using SASS on future projects.
